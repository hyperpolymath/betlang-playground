*Playground for BetLang - Foundational Experimental Language*

toc::[]

== Overview

BetLang is the foundational experimental language for the Next-Gen Languages initiative. It serves as a testbed for language features before they're incorporated into production languages.

=== Key Features

* **Experimental Syntax**: Try new language constructs
* **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable experimental features
* **Rapid Iteration**: Fast compile-test cycles
* **Research Focus**: Academic language research

== Language Design

=== Feature Flags

[source,betlang]
----
#![feature(linear_types)]
#![feature(dependent_types)]
#![feature(effect_system)]

-- Use experimental features
fn example() -> ():
    @linear let resource = acquire()
    use(resource)
----

=== Experimental Syntax

[source,betlang]
----
-- Try different syntaxes
syntax_variant A:
    let x = 5

syntax_variant B:
    x := 5

-- Compare and evaluate
----

== Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
guix install betlang
betlang run experiment.bet
----

== Examples

* `experiments/` - Various language experiments
* `proposals/` - Feature proposals and prototypes
